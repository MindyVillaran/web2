			<h2> Our Hidden Water Use </h2>
			<h3> My content:
				<a href="http://www.earth911.com/home-garden/hidden-water-in-your-products/" target="_blank">Our Hidden Water Use
by Libuse Binder</a></h3>


<p>This is an article that I had in my magazine, and I wanted to reimagine it in my scrolling webpage. It is an article describing how we use water on a day to day basis, not only when washing our hands or taking a shower, but also as consumers buying commercial products. It takes a lot of water to process / make commercial goods that we use everyday, and this article breaks down what some of those numbers are and describes how we can use less hidden water .</p>

<p>I picked this story because there is a good level of variety in the content, and it lends itself well to this project. There are moments with paragraphs of descriptive text that serve more as a narrative, but there are also facts and statistics that are opportunities for infographics and animations. </p>

<p>My site can make use of the web as a medium by using videos, animation, and interaction to have more impact. Some things I plan to include are a fullscreen video in the beginning, objects and graphs that animate in for visual interest, and moments where the user stops scrolling for a moment and interacts with the page (like hovering over something for more information). This makes the information more easily digestible for the user, and makes it more interesting for them as well.
