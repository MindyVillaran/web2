			<h2> My Jewelry Collection </h2>
		
<p>I would like to work with my personal jewelry collection. I have a lot of it, and there are a few different types of jewelry that I have collected over the years, so it has potential for sorting with a few different filters. </p>

<p>So the data set would be around 50 pieces of jewelry that I photograph and work with. The metadata for each of these would be what type it is, when I got it, how I got it, and maybe the price I paid for it. </p>

<p>So, as mentioned, things that I could filter by include 
<ul>
<li>type: necklace, ring, earrings, bracelet</li>
<li>year acquired: 2000 - 2015 (could this be a slider?)</li>
<li>how I got it: gift item, purchased, found, made </li>
</ul)>
</p>

<p>Since the year is a piece of data I'm including, it might be nice to also include the option to sort these from oldest - newest. </p>
